        <h1>BIOSUN Lab Protein Database</h1>
        <p>
            This database contains secondary structure and sequence length data for proteins.<br/>
            The data source is marked under SIM/Uniprot, as the database contains both our simulated values and experimental values taken from Uniprot.<br/><br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h3>Single-Protein Lookup</h3>
        <p>Enter a single accession code to filter results. Leaving blank will bring up all entries in database.</p>
        <form action = "{% url 'searchresults' %}" method = "get">
            <input name = "q" type = "text" placeholder = "Protein Accesion Code">
            <button type = "submit">Search</button>
        </form>
        <h3>CSV-Based Search</h3>
        <p>Upload a .csv file with a column name 'Accession' to use as a list to search with.</p>
