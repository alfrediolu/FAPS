      The help section provides information on how to use the FAPS website and API.
      There are two options for input:
    </p>
    <ul
      class="text-left"
      style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 13px"
    >
      <li>Single-Protein Lookup</li>
      <li>CSV List-Based Search</li>
    </ul>
    <p
      class="text-left"
      style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 14px"
    >
      With the Single-Protein Lookup, you can search for your protein of interest
      with an accession ID (e.g. "P08670", "Q9Y490"). You can also upload a .csv
      file with a column named 'Accession' in the CSV List-Based Search option to filter by. The
      output will return the simulated 3-D structure of proteins and some
      experimentally determined secondary structure information. This includes
      the overall alpha, beta, random coil, and unknown constitute calcuated with both simulated
      and experimental data for each protein.

      The result summarizes the set of secondary structure information from the
      protein of interest in a table, and also in a pie chart. The first column of the table indicates the
      accession ID/protein ID that was searched for; the second column
      provides information about the simulation type the data was generated from; the third column
      is the overall amino acid sequence length of the protein; the fourth column presents a bar chart
      summary of the protein's overall secondary structure, calculated from the simulation and known UniprotKB data.
      The final column allows you to view a more detailed summary of the results, along with the aforementioned pie chart.

      For each protein, the proportion of simulated secondary structure present was calculated
      by dividing the length of each structure type found in the protein by the overall
      amino acid sequence length. The experimentally determined data was scraped from UniprotKB and
      converted to a proportional format to match the simulated data. The overall constitute for each
      was then calculated as the sum total of the product of the simulated proportion and known proportion with
      the product of the UniprotKB proportion with the unknown.
